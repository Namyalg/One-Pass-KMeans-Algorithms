# Data Anonymization Methods

This repository consists of one of the methods for PPDP on archived data.
This repository is the implementation of "An EfÔ¨Åcient Clustering Method for k-
Anonymization."

There is existing code available for the algorithm, but that's written in
Python 2 and the support for Python 2 is about to end. I am not only porting the
code to Python 3 but will also be working on improving the execution time of the
algorithm.
