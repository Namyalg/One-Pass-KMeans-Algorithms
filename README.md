# Data Anonymization Methods

This repository consists of one of the methods for PPDP on archived data.
This repository is the implementation of "An EfÔ¨Åcient Clustering Method for k-
Anonymization."

It is  written in Python 2.7 but the support for Python 2 is about to end. In future
I will be working on porting the code to Python 3.
